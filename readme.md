## Pathfinding Methods Comparison ##

Comparison of A-Star pathfinding algorithm with a simple recursive algorithm that finds for each node the neighbour with the smallest distance to target.
For both methods there are an example in slow motion and one on a terrain.
A-Star is the established method to find always the shortest way from start to a given target. The alternative algorithm also finds a way if one exists, but not necessarily the shortest. This method is marginally faster and may be the choice for a more "human" pathfinding.
